            I started my programming journey since I was 14 years old, in 2014.
            I dived deep into full stack application development since 2019,
            getting my hands on multiple programming languages, databases, and
            different development stacks. I worked as Full Stack developer at WP
            Agency to build web applications on ReactJS and NodeJS. I am
            currently working on a personal project called EventSimplify (demo
            link in project section).
